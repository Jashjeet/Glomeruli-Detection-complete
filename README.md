# Glomeruli-Detection-complete
Using Computer Vision libraries, such as OpenCV, Skimage, Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, I've created different models for automatic detection of Glomeruli in Whole Slide Images. Further, I've used deep learning models such as Unet, Alexnet, Mask RCNN, and Faster RCNN for Nucleus and Glomeruli detection.
